# Java 1.8 Features Overview

## Lambda Expressions
Lambda expressions introduce a concise syntax for writing anonymous methods. They improve code readability by allowing the representation of functions as method arguments.

## Stream API
The Stream API enables functional-style operations on collections, offering a fluent way to work with sequences of elements. It supports powerful operations such as filtering, mapping, and reducing.

## Optional Class
The `Optional` class is designed to handle potentially null values without causing `NullPointerException`. It encourages explicit handling of the presence or absence of a value.

## Generics
Java 1.8 enhances generics with the introduction of the diamond operator (`<>`). It simplifies the instantiation of generic types, making the code cleaner and more readable.

## Method References
Method references provide a concise syntax for lambda expressions, making code more compact. They allow developers to refer to methods without invoking them explicitly.

## Constructor References
Similar to method references, constructor references allow developers to refer to a constructor without instantiating an object explicitly. This enhances code conciseness and readability.

These Java 1.8 features collectively enhance code readability, promote functional programming paradigms, and provide expressive ways to handle common programming patterns.
